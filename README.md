# Tic-Tac-Toe-Solver_202401100300152
INTRODUCTION
•	The project, Tic-Tac-Toe Solver, is a Python-based game where a human competes against an AI opponent.
•	It involves the development of an AI capable of making optimal moves using decision-making algorithms.
•	The AI employs strategies like the Minimax algorithm to analyse the game state and ensure challenging gameplay.
•	This project highlights concepts of game logic, artificial intelligence, and Python programming.
•	It provides an engaging way to explore AI implementation and user interaction in a simple yet strategic game.



METHODOLOGY 
•	Define Objective: Create a Python game where a human plays against an AI in Tic-Tac-Toe.
•	Choose Algorithm: Implement the Minimax algorithm for optimal AI moves.
•	Design Game: Develop a 3x3 grid, symbols (X/O), and turn-based gameplay.
•	Build AI: Code AI to evaluate moves, handle edge cases, and ensure challenging play.
•	Create Interface: Design a simple interface for interaction and results display.
•	Test & Debug: Ensure smooth gameplay by identifying and fixing issues.
•	Document: Finalize the project and prepare detailed documentation.
